          <p>I want to explain the interaction concept I’m designing for my EveryPicture product. My idea is to build a treasure-chest animation as the main entry point of the experience. The chest will react to the user’s mouse movement and scroll direction—scrolling up, down, or hovering will trigger subtle motion cues that make the chest feel alive and responsive. When the user scrolls or moves in the “opening” direction, the chest gradually unlocks; scrolling the opposite way causes it to close. Inside this chest, I will place all the items I plan to showcase. Instead of presenting them in a flat gallery, I want the user to feel as if they are uncovering a collection with personal history and emotional value. Once the chest opens fully, each item becomes clickable. Selecting an item triggers an overlay or mask that rises above the interface. This overlay frames the object in a focused, narrative way—almost like how artifacts or key items are revealed in story-driven games or visual novels. It creates a sense of discovery rather than just “display.” Following Bill’s advice, I also plan to use richer imagery and more layered backgrounds to support the overall mood. By relying on visuals rather than long descriptions, I can communicate the significance of each collectable more intuitively. The intention is to let the environment, textures, lighting, and composition speak for the emotional meaning behind these items—why I created them, why I collected them, and what they represent to me personally.Overall, this approach turns the collection into an interactive narrative space, where the user not only sees the objects but feels the moment of “opening” them—almost like stepping into a small story every time the chest reveals something inside.</p>
